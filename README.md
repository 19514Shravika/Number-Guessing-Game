# Number-Guessing-Game
A fun Python-based game where the computer selects a random number and the player tries to guess it. Includes hints for each guess to guide the player. Great for beginners to practice conditionals, loops, and user input in Python!
🕹️ How to Play
The computer picks a number (e.g., between 1 and 100).

You have a limited number of attempts to guess it.

After each guess, you’ll receive a hint whether your guess is too high or too low.

The game ends when you guess the correct number or run out of attempts.
